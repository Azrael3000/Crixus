****************
 INSTALL Crixus
****************

Prerequisites:

# cmake >= 2.8
# cuda
# hdf5 >= 1.8.7

Crixus uses CMake for compilation. Let us assume that you have the crixus sources in $(CRIXUS_PATH) and you want the building to happen in $(CRIXUS_BUILD) then follow the commands below:

mkdir $(CRIXUS_BUILD)
cd $(CRIXUS_BUILD)
cmake $(CRIXUS_PATH)
make

The binary is then loacated at $(CRIXUS_BUILD)/bin/Release/Crixus

Note that "make install" is not supported yet. To easily change the parameters of cmake you can use ccmake instead.
