****************
 INSTALL Crixus
****************

Prerequisites:

# cmake >= 2.8
# cuda
# hdf5 >= 1.8.7

Crixus uses CMake for compilation. Let us assume that you have crixus in $(CRIXUS_PATH) (the base path and not /path/to/crixus/src/) and you want the building to happen in $(CRIXUS_BUILD) then follow the commands below:

mkdir $(CRIXUS_BUILD)
cd $(CRIXUS_BUILD)
cmake $(CRIXUS_PATH)
make

Note that it is important that $(CRIXUS_BUILD) and $(CRIXUS_PATH) are different, i.e. you should not run cmake in the main Crixus folder.

The binary is then located at $(CRIXUS_BUILD)/bin/Release/Crixus

Note that "make install" is not supported yet. To easily change the parameters of cmake you can use ccmake instead.

If hdf5 cannot be found do to lacking environmental variable you can edit the main CMakeLists.txt which has a commented line that reads:
#set(ENV{HDF5_ROOT} "/your/path/to/hdf5")
Uncomment it and set the respective hdf5 path in order to use your custom installation.
